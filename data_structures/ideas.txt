Heap that also tracks top 'k' values
Eg: to track top '3' values
            9
            |
            8
            |
            7
           / \
          /   \
         5     1
        / \
       4   3
We can still use arrays to store and track parents and children. We need to have a pointer for the root of tree. Then we can get the max and kth max in O(1) time.
Operations will run in O(k + log n)
